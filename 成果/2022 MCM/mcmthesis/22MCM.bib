	abstract = {The ability to predict the systematic decrease of power during physical exertion gives valuable insights into health, performance, and injury. This review surveys the research of power-based models of fatigue and recovery within the area of human performance. Upon a thorough review of available literature, it is observed that the two-parameter critical power model is most popular due to its simplicity. This two-parameter model is a hyperbolic relationship between power and time with critical power as the power-asymptote and the curvature constant denoted by W′. Critical power (CP) is a theoretical power output that can be sustained indefinitely by an individual, and the curvature constant (W′) represents the amount of work that can be done above CP. Different methods and models have been validated to determine CP and W′, most of which are algebraic manipulations of the two-parameter model. The models yield different CP and W′ estimates for the same data depending on the regression fit and rounding off approximations. These estimates, at the subject level, have an inherent day-to-day variability called intra-individual variability (IIV) associated with them, which is not captured by any of the existing methods. This calls for a need for new methods to arrive at the IIV associated with CP and W′. Furthermore, existing models focus on the expenditure of W′ for efforts above CP and do not model its recovery in the sub-CP domain. Thus, there is a need for methods and models that account for (i) the IIV to measure the effectiveness of individual training prescriptions and (ii) the recovery of W′ to aid human performance optimization.},

The aim of this study was therefore to investigate whether maximal incremental exercise decreases respiratory muscle strength. We hypothesized that respiratory muscle strength (maximal pressure) will decrease after maximal incremental exercise to exhaustion. 36 runners and 23 cyclists completed a maximal incremental test on a treadmill or a cycle ergometer with continuous monitoring of expired gases. Maximal inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory (MEP) pressure measurements were taken at rest and post- exercise. At rest, the MIP and MEP were 140±25 and 172±27 in runners vs. 115±26 and 146±33 in cyclists (p{\textless}0.05 between groups, respectively). The rest values of MIP and MEP were correlated to the V̇O2peak in all athletes, r=0.34, p{\textless}0.01 and r=0.36, p{\textless}0.01, respectively. At exhaustion, the MIP and MEP decreased significantly post- test by 13±7\% and 13±5\% in runners vs. 17±11\% and 15±10\% in cyclists (p{\textgreater}0.05), respectively. Our results suggest that respiratory muscle strength is decreased following maximal incremental exercise in trained runners and cyclists.},

	abstract = {The linear tapering method duration can be determinant for sport performance. Objective
The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of linear tapering duration method on anaerobic power and capacity in road cyclists.
Materials and methods
Seventeen male road cyclists, aged between 18 and 30 years were randomly selected within the study criteria. Participants performed 16 weeks of training, adopting the undulating periodization with weekly variation of the training load. The tapering phase lasted 4 weeks, using the linear tapering method, reducing only the training volume: 85\% in the first, 70\% in the second, 55\% in the third and 40\% in the fourth week. The Wingate test was used to evaluate anaerobic power and capacity. Wingate was performed by the cyclists before the start of the season, at the end of the last week of each mesocycle (Preparatory I, Specific I and Specific II) and at the end of each week in the tapering phase.
Results
The results revealed a time effect for anaerobic power (P{\textless}0.01) and capacity (P{\textless}0.01), with an increase after the preparatory phase I compared to pre-experimental (P=0.01), maintenance until phase specific II (P=0.01), maintenance in the third week of tapering (P{\textgreater}0.05), finishing with attenuation in the fourth week of tapering (P=0.01).
Conclusion
It was concluded that 2 weeks of tapering was enough to improve the anaerobic power and capacity in road cyclists.
Résumé
La réduction linéaire de la charge d’entraînement peut être déterminante pour la performance sportive.
Objectif
L’objectif de cette étude était d’analyser l’effet de la durée d’un affûtage linéaire sur la puissance anaérobie et la capacité dans la pratique cyclosportive.
Matériels et méthodes
Dix-sept cyclistes masculins, âgés entre 18 et 30 ans ont été choisis au hasard. Les participants ont effectué 16 semaines de formation, adoptant la périodisation ondulante avec la variation de la charge d’entraînement hebdomadaire. La phase d’affûtage a duré 4 semaines, en utilisant la méthode linéaire d’affûtage, réduisant uniquement le volume de formation : 85 \% dans la première, 70 \% dans la deuxième, 55 \% à la troisième et 40 \% dans la quatrième semaine. Le test de Wingate a été utilisé pour évaluer la capacité et puissance anaérobie. Wingate a été interprété par les cyclistes avant le début de la saison, à la fin de la dernière semaine de chaque mésocycle (préparatoire I, propres I et II spécifique) et à la fin de chaque semaine dans la phase d’affûtage.
Résultats
Les résultats révèlent un effet temps puissance anaérobie (p{\textless}0,01) et capacité (p{\textless}0,01), avec une augmentation après la phase préparatoire I, comparé au préalable expérimental (p=0,01), entretien jusqu’en phase II spécifique (p=0,01), entretien dans la troisième semaine d’affûtage (p{\textgreater}0,05), finissant par une atténuation dans la quatrième semaine d’affûtage (p=0,01).
Conclusion
Il a été conclu que deux semaines d’affûtage ont été suffisantes pour améliorer la puissance anaérobie et la capacité dans la pratique cyclosportive.},

We also provide a comparison between our model and published power data for top level cyclists and recent Tour de France winners such as Chris Froome and Vincenzo Nibali. This juxtaposition showcases not only how well our model predicts stage-winning times, but also the extent to which our model matches reality.

The effects of submaximal performances on SCrit and PCrit were studied with the results of two theoretical maximal exercises multiplied by coefficients lower or equal to 1 (from 0.8 to 1 for protocol 1; from 0.95 to 1 for protocols 2 and 3): coefficient C1 for the shortest exercises and C2 for the longest exercises. Arbitrary units were used for exhaustion times (tlim), speeds (or power-output in cycling) and distances (or work in cycling). The submaximal-performance effects on SCrit and PCrit were computed from two ranges of tlim (1-4 and 1-7). These effects have been compared for a low-endurance athlete (exponent = 0.8 in the power-law model of Kennelly) and a high-endurance athlete (exponent = 0.95). Unexpectedly, the effects of submaximal performances on SCrit and PCrit are lower in protocol 1. For the 3 protocols, the effects of submaximal performances on SCrit, and PCrit, are low in many cases and are lower when the range of tlim is longer. The results of the present theoretical study confirm the possibility of the computation of SCrit and PCrit from several submaximal exercises performed in the same session.},

Many studies have examined the methodological limitations of deriving CP, but few studies have examined the responses to exercise at CP in well-trained individuals. The purpose of the present study was to examine the physiological responses to exercise at CP. Seven male subjects [mean (SD) body mass 75.6 (6.4) kg, maximum oxygen uptake 4.6 (0.7) l min(-1)] performed three constant load tests to derive CP. Subjects then exercised at CP until volitional exhaustion. Heart rate, oxygen consumption and blood lactate concentration were measured throughout. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant differences over time in heart rate 118 (24) to 177(5) beats min(-1), oxygen consumption 3.7 (0.6) to 4.1 (0.5) l min(-1)and blood lactate concentration 4.3 (1.8) to 6.5 (2.0) mM. All seven subjects completed 20 min of exercise with the range of time to failure at CP from 20 min 1 s to 40 min 37 s. Time to failure and maximum oxygen consumption were significantly correlated (r = 0.779, P {\textless} 0.05).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of course profile on the optimal pacing strategy in road cycling. For that reason, three course profiles, built up by cubical splines, were simulated with a numerical program for a fictional cyclist. The numerical program solves the equations of motion of the athlete and bicycle while an optimal design algorithm is connected to the simulation, aiming to minimize the time between start and finish. The optimization is constrained by a power-endurance concept named the critical power model for intermittent exercise. Three course profiles with the same total elevation but different number of hills were studied. The time gains of an optimized pacing strategy were 3.0\%, 5.0\%, and 2.3\% and the speed variances at the optimized pacing strategy were 6.54\%, 1.18\%, and 0.84\% for the single plateau, double hill, and quadruple hill courses respectively. Hence, the course profile has great effect on the optimal pacing strategy. In addition, the results show that the potential improvement of adopting an optimized pacing strategy is substantial at the highest level of competition.},

A total of 47 Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed with the 3D RANS equations, standard k-ε model and scalable wall functions and validated with wind-tunnel measurements. In groups of up to 5 identical riders with d up to 1 m, the last rider has the lowest drag but this is not the case for larger groups. A closely drafting group of 7, 8 or 9 riders has an average drag that is about half that of an isolated rider. However, for much longer theoretical single pacelines, a staggered peloton configuration can yet be about two times more drag efficient.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that the power output attained at the end of a 3-min all-out cycling test would be equivalent to critical power.
METHODS: Ten habitually active subjects performed a ramp test, two 3-min all-out tests against a fixed resistance to establish the end-test power (EP) and the work done above the EP (WEP), and five constant-work rate tests to establish the critical power (CP) and the curvature constant parameter (W') using the work-time and 1/time models.
RESULTS: The power output in the 3-min trial declined to a steady level within 135 s. The EP was 287 +/- 55 W, which was not significantly different from, and highly correlated with, CP (287 +/- 56 W; P = 0.37, r = 0.99). The standard error for the estimation of CP using EP was approximately 6 W, and in 8 of 10 cases, EP agreed with CP to within 5 W. Similarly, the WEP derived from the 3-min test (15.0 +/- 4.7 kJ) was not significantly different from, and correlated with, W' (16.0 +/- 3.8 kJ; P = 0.35; r = 0.84).
CONCLUSIONS: During a 3-min all-out cycling test, power output declined to a stable value in approximately the last 45 s, and this power output was not significantly different from the independently measured critical power.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To validate and compare a novel model based on the critical power (CP) concept that describes the entire domain of maximal mean power (MMP) data from cyclists.Methods: An omni-domain power-duration (OmPD) model was derived whereby the rate of W' expenditure is bound by maximum sprint power and the power at prolonged durations declines from CP log-linearly. The three-parameter CP (3CP) and exponential (Exp) models were likewise extended with the log-linear decay function (Om3CP and OmExp). Each model bounds W' using a different nonconstant function, W'eff (effective W'). Models were fit to MMP data from nine cyclists who also completed four time-trials (TTs).Results: The OmPD and Om3CP residuals (4 ± 1\%) were smaller than the OmExp residuals (6 ± 2\%; P {\textless} 0.001). W'eff predicted by the OmPD model was stable between 120-1,800 s, whereas it varied for the Om3CP and OmExp models. TT prediction errors were not different between models (7 ± 5\%, 8 ± 5\%, 7 ± 6\%; P = 0.914).Conclusion: The OmPD offers similar or superior goodness-of-fit and better theoretical properties compared to the other models, such that it best extends the CP concept to short-sprint and prolonged-endurance performance.},

	abstract = {Exercise has a profound effect on muscle growth, which can occur only if muscle protein synthesis exceeds muscle protein breakdown; there must be a positive muscle protein balance. Resistance exercise improves muscle protein balance, but, in the absence of food intake, the balance remains negative (i.e., catabolic). The response of muscle protein metabolism to a resistance exercise bout lasts for 24-48 hours; thus, the interaction between protein metabolism and any meals consumed in this period will determine the impact of the diet on muscle hypertrophy. Amino acid availability is an important regulator of muscle protein metabolism. The interaction of postexercise metabolic processes and increased amino acid availability maximizes the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis and results in even greater muscle anabolism than when dietary amino acids are not present. Hormones, especially insulin and testosterone, have important roles as regulators of muscle protein synthesis and muscle hypertrophy. Following exercise, insulin has only a permissive role on muscle protein synthesis, but it appears to inhibit the increase in muscle protein breakdown. Ingestion of only small amounts of amino acids, combined with carbohydrates, can transiently increase muscle protein anabolism, but it has yet to be determined if these transient responses translate into an appreciable increase in muscle mass over a prolonged training period.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was threefold: (a) to compare the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) with critical power (CP); (b) to describe the relationship of MLSS with rowing performances; and (c) to verify the agreement of MLSS with several exercise intensity thresholds in rowers. Fourteen male rowers (mean [SD]: age = 26 [13] years; height = 1.82 [0.05] m; body mass = 81.0 [7.6] kg) performed on a rowing ergometer: (I) discontinuous incremental test with 3 min stages and 30-s recovery intervals (INC3min); (II) continuous incremental test with 60-s stages (INC1min); (III) two to four constant workload tests to determine MLSS; and (IV) performance tests of 500, 1000, 2000 and 6000 m to determine CP. Twenty-seven exercise intensity thresholds based on blood lactate, heart rate and ventilatory responses were determined by incremental tests, and then compared with MLSS. CP (257 [38] W) was higher than MLSS (187 [25] W; p {\textless} 0.001), with a very large mean difference (37\%), large typical error of estimate (14\%) and moderate correlation (r = 0.48). Despite the correlations between MLSS and most intensity thresholds (r {\textgreater} 0.70), all presented low correspondence (TEE {\textgreater} 5\%), with a lower bias found between MLSS and the first intensity thresholds (-12.5\% to 4.1\%). MLSS was correlated with mean power during 500 m (r = 0.65), 1000 m (r = 0.86) and 2000 m (r = 0.78). In conclusion, MLSS intensity is substantially lower than CP and presented low agreement with 27 incremental-derived thresholds, questioning their use to estimate MLSS during rowing ergometer exercise.Highlights MLSS was substantially lower than CP in rowing exercise with a mean difference of 37\%, much larger than the difference commonly found in running and cycling exercise (i.e., ?10\%).A clear disagreement was reported between MLSS and 27 physiological thresholds determined in different incremental tests.There is a positive association of MLSS with 500, 1000 and 2000 m rowing ergometer performance tests.},

It begins with an examination of the critical power model and its assumptions. Although remarkably robust, this model has a number of shortcomings. Attention to these has led to the development of more realistic and more detailed derivatives of the critical power model. The mathematical solutions to and associated behaviour of these models when subjected to imposed “exercise” can be applied as a means of gaining a deeper understanding of the bioenergetics of human exercise performance.},

	abstract = {The critical power test is a well-established procedure that provides estimates of two important parameters characterizing work performance; anaerobic work capacity (AWC) and critical power (CP). The concept proscribes a hyperbolic relationship between power output (P) and time to exhaustion (t), given by (P - CP)t = AWC. Since evidence now exists that the procedure overestimates CP and underestimates AWC, this study was undertaken to investigate the effect of relaxing the requirement that the time asymptote necessarily be at zero. Using data from a previous study, it is shown that in so doing, (1) a time asymptote significantly less than zero is obtained, (2) significantly smaller estimates of CP and larger estimates of AWC are obtained, (3) a third parameter is introduced that theoretically represents maximal instantaneous power, (4) it implies that the maximal power that could be developed at any instant is proportional to the amount of AWC remaining at that instant, which in turn implies that (5) at exhaustion not necessary all of AWC is consumed.},
